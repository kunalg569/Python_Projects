## Executive Summary

The analysis of hotel bookings provides comprehensive insights into patterns and trends, focusing on cancellations, booking channels, customer demographics, and financial aspects. The overall cancellation rate stands at 37.1%, with city hotels experiencing a higher cancellation ratio of 41.7% compared to 27.9% for resort hotels.

Most bookings are made through online travel agencies (Online TA), accounting for 56,402 bookings, followed by offline travel agents and tour operators (Offline TA/TO) with 24,159 bookings, and group bookings at 19,721. Direct bookings amount to 12,448. Among these, online travel agencies also have the highest number of cancellations at 20,738, indicating a need to focus on reducing cancellations from this channel.

Financial analysis shows that the average daily rate (ADR) fluctuates significantly during cancellations. Additionally, seasonal trends reveal that bookings peak during summer months, with city hotels showing higher weekday bookings, likely due to business travel patterns.

Customer demographics indicate that most customers make zero or one special request, and the majority do not require car parking spaces. These insights suggest that enhancing specific services based on customer feedback, particularly for city hotels, could reduce cancellation rates and improve overall satisfaction.

Visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, effectively illustrate the distribution of cancellations, market segments, and special requests. Line and bar charts further highlight ADR trends and comparisons between canceled and non-canceled bookings.
