    <h2 style="color:#333333; text-align:center;">Objective:</h2>
    <p style="color:#555555; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">
        Develop a predictive model to identify significant variables influencing the demand for shared bikes post-pandemic in the American market, specifically focusing not only on weather conditions but for all features as well. This model will empower BikeIndia to make data-driven decisions and effectively meet customer demand. Furthermore, test the impact of the features affecting the demand of bikes.

    <h2 style="color:#333333; text-align:center;">About the Dataset:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Categorized into spring, summer, fall, and winter.</li>
        <li><strong>Year:</strong> Recorded as 2011 or 2012.</li>
        <li><strong>Month:</strong> Ranges from 1 to 12.</li>
        <li><strong>Hour:</strong> Time of the day (0 to 23).</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday:</strong> Indicates if it's a holiday.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekday:</strong> Day of the week.</li>
        <li><strong>Workingday:</strong> 1 if neither weekend nor holiday, else 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Weathersit:</strong> Describes weather conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature, Feeling Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed:</strong> Normalized weather attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Casual, Registered, Count:</strong> Counts of bike rentals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#555555; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">
        For this analysis, historical data on bike demands across various weather conditions in the American market is provided by $Woom$. The dataset contains information on season, year, month, hour, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather situation, temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, windspeed, and counts of casual, registered, and total rental bikes.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:#333333; text-align:center;">Goal:</h2>
    <p style="color:#555555; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">
        Create a robust predictive model that accurately captures the relationship between independent variables (weather conditions) and bike demand. Use ANOVA along with Post_hoc test to test the significance of features used in model building. This model will assist BikeIndia in optimizing operations and maximizing profits by effectively meeting customer demand in the post-pandemic market.
