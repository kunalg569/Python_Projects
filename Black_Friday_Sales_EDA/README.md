## Problem statement:
A retail company “Wisconn American Dreams Pvt. Ltd.” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories during Black Friday Sales days. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month. They want to gain insights on the customer purchase pattern and other potential mediums of increase in sales.

# Goal:
Perform EDA on the Black Friday and gain insights into *purchasing power* of the customer for the selected listed products during Black Firday Sale days.

# Research Questions
* How do customer demographics influence purchase behavior?
    * Investigate if there's a correlation between age, gender, marital status, city type, and stay duration in the current city with the purchase amount.
* What is the impact of product categories on purchase amounts?
    * Analyze how different product categories contribute to the overall purchase amount and identify the categories with the highest sales.
* How does the combination of product categories affect purchase behavior?
    * Explore if there are common combinations of product categories (Product_Category_1, Product_Category_2, Product_Category_3) that lead to higher purchase amounts.
