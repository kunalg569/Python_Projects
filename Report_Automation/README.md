## Background 
In today's fast-paced business environment, the need for efficient and accurate reporting is paramount for informed decision-making. At Olist, a leading player in the Brazilian e-commerce landscape, one of the crucial tasks at hand is **automating** the generation of weekly revenue reports.

Key Questions to Address in the Weekly Report:

* How much revenue did we make this week? By region?
* What was the w/w change in revenue?
* What was the y/y growth in revenue?
* What percentage of our sales target have we reached (QTD, and EoQ)?
* What are our average ratings for the week?
* What was the average time it took for an order to be fullfilled and delivered?
